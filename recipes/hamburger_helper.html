            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Chop onion and garlic. Add oil into pan and brown the meat first. You can add a bit of the spice mix here, not all of it but a couple pinches.</li>
                    <li>Add onions and garlic after the meat has cooked a bit. Cook till onion becomes translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add stock, milk, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and spice mixture and stir. Bring to a boil and add the 250g of pasta and cook the pasta in the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Cook the pasta for the time noted on the bag, but in my experience, hover over the pan and make sure that there is enough water covering everything and check the pasta often.</li>
                    <li>Once the water has cooked off and the noodles are cooked, remove from heat and add cheese. Stir through and let sit covered with no heat for at least 5 min.</li>
                    <li>Dish up and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
