            <!-- Description of the recipe goes here -->          
            <p>Spaghetti! Specifically a type of bolognese sauce over spaghetti noodles; very tasty indeed. This dish holds an important choke hold on my heart and stomach, it is one of my favorite dishes that my wife brought into my life when we first met. Sounds overly dramatic, but this specific version of spaghetti bolognese is by far my favorite and tastes absolutely wonderful! :D</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Dice all vegetables and pour into a skillet/pan a glug of any cooking oil. Put onions and bellpepper in first and cook until the onions start to turn transparent.</li>
                    <li>Add ground meat and break it up, pour spice mixture and garlic on the meat and mix. Let the meat cook until you see no more red bits in the pan.</li>
                    <li>After a bit of time, about 5 min, spritz 2 tablespoons of tomato paste into the mixture and mix till it coats the meat and vegetables. After it starts to stick to the pan, pour a glug of wine to deglaze the pan and mix.</li>
                    <li>Add tomatoes and about 250ml of water along with 1 bullion cube/stock and mix.</li>
                    <li>Let cook for at the very least 25min before eating, best is to let it slowly cook for an hour or even more if you have the time, but it will be tortuous.</li>
                    <li>Make pasta, dont forget to salt the water! Follow the instructions given on the pasta that you're using.</li>
                    <li>Plate up how you would like and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
<!-- Enjoy! -->
